             "During the process of applying for my son’s UK study visa in August 2014, we became aware of the requirement to provide a tuberculosis test to be validated by the International Organization for Migration (IOM). With only one test centre in Lagos and a backlog of applications, we were only able to secure a test date that would have meant that my son’s visa application would only be submitted a week after resumption and thus possibly lead to him missing the school term. It was at this point that a friend referred us to El-Dega Travel Plus Nigeria Limited. We received prompt attention and immediate action was taken to secure an earlier date. Furthermore, on the day of the test a representative of El-Dega guided us through the process and also arranged to collect the result which would have posed a logistic challenge for us. As a result, we were able to submit the visa application and obtain his visa application without him missing valuable school time. In my opinion, their ability to leverage on their ecosystem stakeholders demonstrated their capacity to deliver satisfactory service to their clients."

             "I have been a client with Eldega Education Advisory services for four years. I can attest to their well organised and computed system in making sure that they not only advise, search and eventually place the child in a good institution but also follow through for all the years the child will be in school. Their effective and efficient services give me as a parent confidence and a feeling of well being to leave my children in a distant land to pursue their education. I hereby encourage other Parents to trust them with their children. Thank you!"
